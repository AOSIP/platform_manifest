AOSiP
===========

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the AOSiP trees, use a command like this:

```bash
repo init -u ssh://git@github.com/AOSiP/platform_manifest.git -b oreo
```
Then to sync up:
```bash
repo sync -c -f -j8 --force-sync --no-clone-bundle --no-tags
```
As the AOSP/CAF repos aren't ever updated till we update the tag we're tracking, for subsequent syncs simply run
```bash
./sync.sh
```
Building the source
---------------

The source at AOSiP is well configured for building.

```bash
source build/envsetup.sh
lunch aosip_device-userdebug
time mka kronic
```

If you would like to limit the number of threads being used in a build to X, change the last command to

```bash
time make -jX kronic
```

## Submitting Patches ##

You can submit your patches to AOSiP just by registering at "http://review.aosiprom.com"

Open up terminal to create your ssh keys required for submitting patches to gerrit and type in:

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

In our gerrit click on your "Avatar" on the top right, then on "Settings".

While in 'Settings' Click on "SSH Public Keys" on the left hand side and then on "Add Key".

Then copy and paste the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to "Gerrit SSH Public Keys".

You can send patches to us by using these commands in terminal:

cd PROJECT - i.e
```bash
cd packages/apps/OwlsNest
```
Make edits that you want to see .....
```bash
git add .
git commit -a
```
Type out a commit message that makes sense for the proposed change

Ctrl O, then Ctrl X to save and exit

```bash
git push ssh://USERNAME@review.aosiprom.com:29418/PROJECT HEAD:refs/for/BRANCH
```
BRANCH - i.e oreo
PROJECT - i.e AOSIP/platform_packages_apps_OwlsNest
USERNAME - i.e Shreesha

If you are going to make extra additions, just repeat steps (don't start a new patch), but instead of git commit -m
use git commit --amend. Gerrit will recognize it as a new patchset.

For more information on how to push to a gerrit, please read the
following: [Link](https://wiki.mahara.org/wiki/Developer_Area/Contributing_Code)

Also to make this even easier, you can use a universal gerrit script provided by PAC:

## Maintaining Authorship ##
Please make sure if you submit a patch/fix from another ROM that you maintain authorship.
This is very important to not only us but to the entire open source community. It's what keeps it going and encourages more developers to 
contribute their work.

If you manually cherry pick a patch/fix please add the original author prior to pushing to our gerrit.
This task is very easy and is usually done after you commit a patch/fix locally.

i.e - Once you type in "git commit -a" the commit message and you have saved it, type in the following:

```bash
git commit --amend --author "Author <email@address.com>"
```

So it should look like this once you get all author's information:

```bash
git commit --amend --author "Shreesha <shreeshu10@gmail.com>"
```
